# Hack High School - API's with Node.js

## Concepts

This is the guided introduction to setting up Node and Express.

- **00** - This is a basic 'Hello World' server.

- **01** - This exercise focuses on setting up a dummy DB and creating a GET all users route

- **02** - Here we expand our API to create new users. We add middleware and learn to us the FS module.

## ToDo List APi

This is the final challenge. Students must create their own API for keeping track of ToDos.

- **API 0** - Uses db.json file to store data
- **API 1** - Connects to an instance of MongoDB

## Expansions

- **00** - Heroku Hosting

- **01** - Chat room -> Will need to provide frontend
