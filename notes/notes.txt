1.	How long it took you to complete the first runthrough of the project, in hours:
	It took me 2-3 hours (but I have experience so I would guess it would take the students at least 3-4x longer). I didn't read through all the docs, just clicked the links and checked the relevance, but reading the links alone would take a few hours (of learning).

2.	Notes on what issues you found:
	- Mongo section was a little vague without much information on what Mongo is.
		* I added more information (explanation and additional links) into the PDF. 

	- The Node pdf just jumped in without explaining the bigger picture too well.
		* I added a diagram (I made it so I didn't need to cite it) to the Goals section and explained what we'll be learning and why.

	- A few words and concepts mentioned without explanation (middleware, callback functions, backend).
		* I just added some more information for these. In some cases it's just a few extra words, an additional link, or an explanation.

	- A gap between Ex. 03 in Node.js and the mandatory pt.2 section. There's a link to Mongoose but not much more.
		* I added a section in Mandatory pt.2 where I just walk through a simple Mongoose route.

3.	Notes on which issues you fixed. (If both you and the project author made improvements to the project during this process, assign credit judiciously.)
	* cropped the mongo_*.png files to fit comfortably into the file
	* added links throughout, especially tried to add official docs links.
	* added more explanations throughout
	* SEE ALL THE CHANGES MADE IN THE MONGODB_CHANGES_HIGHLIGHTED.EN.PDF AND NODEJS_CHANGES_HIGHLIGHTED.EN.PDF FILES

General Notes:
* I cloned https://github.com/donald-stolz/H2S-NodeJS.git, and put the pdf and tex files into the directory 'before/PDF_TEX_BEFORE'.
* 'before' holds the whole repo and the PDF_TEX_BEFORE holds just the pdf and tex files, which are where the changes were made.
* 'after' holds the whole repo with the changed files updated, and changed_files holds only the files that were changed. The changes_highlighted files highlight all the changes made to make correction easier.
